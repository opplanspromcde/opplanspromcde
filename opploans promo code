Payday loans are becoming more popular, and more in demand, as the credit squeeze continues. But can you afford to take one? That is a question that many people ask of themselves. And rightly so, because unless they go about it the right way, they can end up paying a massive amount of interest.

So, if you feel that you need a payday loan how should you go about it? First, don't opt for the first online advert you see. Not all payday loans are the same, and you can usually get a deal that suits you. You should look for a deal that has a limited 'rollover' period.

Although a payday loan should strictly be repaid next payday, many people find themselves unable to do so and it carries on for another month. That is when the rollover comes into play. The rollover involves another fee payment. You don't pay interest as such with a payday loan: you pay a 'fee'. For example, with a payday loans of $400 you could pay a $50 fee. That works out at an interest rate of 25% a month, or an APR of 300%. If you miss the payment, then you pay a rollover fee of another $50, so that your APR has suddenly risen to 600%. So a payday loan can be very expensive unless you make sure that you pay it. So, how do you do that?
