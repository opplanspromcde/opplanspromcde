Online payday loans are exactly what it says on the tin. They are loans that you can get till next payday, and you can apply for them online. People who seek them generally have a pressing and urgent financial need that has to be met immediately, and that cannot wait until next payday.

Such loans are taken to meet a sudden and unexpected expense, such as an urgent car repair for somebody that relies on their car for their work, or a serious family illness or crisis that calls for unplanned long distance travel. You do not immediately have the finances to cover the costs, and don't have the time to wait until payday. What do you do?

The answer could be an online payday loan, and while the APR (annual percentage rate) for such loans is high, you only have it for less than a month after which it is paid in full in a single payment. Because it is a special type of loan, there are specialist companies that offer them, and also many cowboys that will take advantage of your need if you are not careful.
